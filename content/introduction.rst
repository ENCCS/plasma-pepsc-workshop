Vlasiator
=========

`**Vlasiator** <https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/vlasiator>`_ (`GitHub <https://github.com/fmihpc/vlasiator>`_) is the state-of-the-art hybrid-Vlasov simulation for ion-scale physics in a global magnetospheric setting. It is the only 6D hybrid-Vlasov code capable of simulating the Earth's magnetosphere. In Vlasiator, ions are represented as velocity distribution functions, while electrons are massless charge-neutralizing fluid, enabling a self-consistent global plasma simulation that can describe multi-temperature plasmas to resolve non-MHD processes that currently cannot be self-consistently described by the existing global space weather simulations. The novelty is that by modelling ions as velocity distribution functions the outcome will be numerically noiseless. Due to the multi-dimensional approach at ion scales, Vlasiator's computational challenges are immense.

Vlasiator simulates the dynamics of plasma using a hybrid-Vlasov model, where protons are described by their distribution function f(r,v,t) in ordinary (r) and velocity (v) space, and electrons are a charge-neutralising fluid. This approach neglects electron kinetic effects but retains ion kinetics. The time-evolution of f(r,v,t) is given by Vlasov's equation,

which is coupled self-consistently to Maxwell's equations giving the evolution of the electric and magnetic fields E and B. Maxwell's equations neglect the displacement current.

The equations are closed by a generalised Ohm's law including the Hall term (and the electron pressure term).

State-of-the-art
----------------

Vlasiator is parallelized at multiple scales via MPI, threading support and vectorization, and we are continuously improving the performance and the feature set. GPU porting is in progress: solvers have been ported, but they need to be optimized for GPUs to be useful in production.

The data structures in Vlasiator have been optimized to propagate the 6D solution efficiently with explicit solvers. The velocity distribution functions are associated with a spatial, hierarchically-adapted Cartesian grid (the Vlasov grid, SpatialGrid or the AMR grid), with each such spatial cell containing a VDF for each ion species in the simulation. The VDF themselves are stored on a Cartesian velocity-space grid as a sparse data structure - otherwise the production simulations could not fit any available computers. This implies slight loss of mass at the fringes (under a set sparsity threshold, the VDF is not stored), but the VDF can optionally be re-scaled to conserve mass. Suitably chosen sparsity thresholds enable global runs with negligible adverse effects.

The numerical algorithm for the propagation of the Vlasov equation is based on operator splitting: spatial translation and velocity-space acceleration are leapfrogged. Spatial translation remaps the VDF as 1D shears. The acceleration re-mapping of the VDF is handled by the semi-Lagrangian SLICE-3D method by Zerroukat and Allen (2012), by decomposing v-space rotation and translation to a series of shear operations. These mappings are conservative by themselves.

Spatial AMR has lately enabled truly 6D simulations of the Earth's magnetosphere (see Ganse+2023). The initial 6D production runs have used statically-refined grid, with a dynamic AMR currently being ran.

Recently, we have also included a proper ionospheric inner boundary condition, with an ionosphere solver along the lines of MHD solvers. Further developments are ongoing, incl. better ionization and conductivity profiles. Outer boundary conditions now include the possibility of time-varying solar wind parameters.
