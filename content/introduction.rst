Vlasiator
=========

`**Vlasiator** <https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/vlasiator>`_ (`GitHub <https://github.com/fmihpc/vlasiator>`_) is the state-of-the-art hybrid-Vlasov simulation for ion-scale physics in a global magnetospheric setting. It is the only 6D hybrid-Vlasov code capable of simulating the Earth's magnetosphere. In Vlasiator, ions are represented as velocity distribution functions, while electrons are massless charge-neutralizing fluid, enabling a self-consistent global plasma simulation that can describe multi-temperature plasmas to resolve non-MHD processes that currently cannot be self-consistently described by the existing global space weather simulations. The novelty is that by modelling ions as velocity distribution functions the outcome will be numerically noiseless. Due to the multi-dimensional approach at ion scales, Vlasiator's computational challenges are immense.

Vlasiator simulates the dynamics of plasma using a hybrid-Vlasov model, where protons are described by their distribution function f(r,v,t) in ordinary (r) and velocity (v) space, and electrons are a charge-neutralising fluid. This approach neglects electron kinetic effects but retains ion kinetics. The time-evolution of f(r,v,t) is given by Vlasov's equation,

which is coupled self-consistently to Maxwell's equations giving the evolution of the electric and magnetic fields E and B. Maxwell's equations neglect the displacement current.

The equations are closed by a generalised Ohm's law including the Hall term (and the electron pressure term).

State-of-the-art
----------------

Vlasiator is parallelized at multiple scales via MPI, threading support and vectorization, and we are continuously improving the performance and the feature set. GPU porting is in progress: solvers have been ported, but they need to be optimized for GPUs to be useful in production.
