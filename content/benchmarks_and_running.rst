Instructor's guide
==================

Why we teach this lesson
------------------------

Vlasiator requires a lot of resources to run, but thankfully it scales pretty well (super-linearly!). Good scaling requires, however, understanding of the system in use, and knowing how to profile and optimize the HPC environment from balancing threads vs tasks to parallel I/O. Here we introduce built-in Vlasiator profiling tools, rules-of-thumb for setting up the Slurm batch jobs, LUSTRE striping and ROMIO flags relevant to LUMI.
